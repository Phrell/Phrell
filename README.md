I'm currently an undergraduate student in the Physics Department at Fudan University. 

now obsessed with statistical mechanics; 

I find it fun but despairingly hard too. 

In my leisure time, I love playing table tennis or games like Clash Royale (well, I used to... the game is terrible now). 

I guess there should be more to show you, but I'm just stressed out after an entire finals season. 

I hope I'll be alright, so see you next time maybe?
